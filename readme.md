## PHP 8.1.9 Authentication System

This is an authentication base built in PHP Version 8. It is made to be relatively simple for anyone to build off of. 

I think that due to how I made this it's pretty easy to go from here to start building a fullscale application.

## How to modify

All of the frontend is stored inside of the src directory. It's quite empty right now mainly because this is just to be for the backend.
But you can modify it all you want and go from them.

The database settings are in /classes/Database.class.php and you can modify them to fit your database needs.

In the future I will probably integrate verification into this with emails but for now this will do.
